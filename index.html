 <h3> Chiken</h3>
Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take 
up the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all views: 
desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really tall, you can either fill it out 
with a LOT of text or simply set its height to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall 
enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure 
its background color is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content. 
(Hint: don't forget to have an element with a class='container' or class='container-fluid' 
wrapping your grid. Remember that to have the grid do something "always", i.e., no matter what 
browser window size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case, 
since we want the section to take up the entire row, use col-xs-12.)
